# Dotfiles
First, I'd like to point out that _I have no idea what I'm doing_â„¢, but hopefully this will change as this setup matures and prospers.

## Installation
1. First, make sure you've installed Xcode (and the Xcode Command Line Tools: `$ xcode-select --install`).
2. Make sure you're in your Home-directory (just type `cd` silly), and run `git clone git@github.com:epavletic/dotfiles.git .dotfiles`.
