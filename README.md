# Dotfiles
First, I'd like to point out that _I have no idea what I'm doing_™, but hopefully this will change as this setup matures and prospers.

## Backstory
This repo came about when I realized that I dreaded doing full reinstalls of my Mac because of the sheer amount of initial config required to get it up to speed. 

## Cool story guy, so how does this work?

1. First, make sure you've installed Xcode and the Xcode Command Line Tools: Just download Xcode from the Mac App Store and then run `$ xcode-select --install` in the terminal.
2. Make sure you're in your Home-directory (just type `cd` silly), and run 

```git clone git@github.com:epavletic/dotfiles.git .dotfiles```.

## ToDo’s
- [ ] Support for setting up Sublime Text with settings, key bindings, theme and packages.
